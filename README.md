Script for person checking presence.

I made this simple script for my friend to check if current person came in and left place.
It uses Telegram API to send notification to Telegram BOT.

## New bot for notification

search for [@botfather](https://t.me/botfather) and write
```
/newbot
```
to get HTTP API key (at first set name and privacy and profile picture ...)


search for [@jsondumpbot](https://t.me/jsondumpbot) to get chat-id 
```
...
    "chat": {
      "id": 2??????5,
      "first_name": "???",
      "username": "???",
      "type": "private"
    },
...
```
